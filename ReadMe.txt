As permitted, we have trained two separate models for letters and emojis.

The letters.h5 file predicts letters correctly but may give garbage values for emojis.
The emojis.h5 model file predicts emojis correctly but gives garbage values for letters.

Pass the path of emoji to be tested in the emoji_solver(path) function.

Pass the path of letters to be tested in the letter_solver(path) function.
